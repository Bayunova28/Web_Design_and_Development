                            One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his 
                            bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
                            see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, 
                            pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's 
                            happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream.

                        <p>
                            A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and 
                            above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a
                            nice, gilded frame. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that 
                            covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window 
                            at the dull weather.

                            the pane, which made him feel sad.
